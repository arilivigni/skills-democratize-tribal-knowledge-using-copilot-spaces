# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation! This collection of guides provides everything you need to understand and execute projects using OctoAcme's proven methodologies. Whether you're a new team member getting started or an experienced practitioner looking for reference materials, these docs will help you navigate our project delivery processes effectively.

## About OctoAcme's Project Management Approach

OctoAcme follows a customer-first, iterative approach to project management that emphasizes clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety. Our methodology is built around five core principles: prioritizing customer value and usability, delivering small testable increments, establishing clear ownership with named Project Managers and Product Leads, making data-informed decisions based on measurable impact, and fostering an environment where feedback and learning are encouraged.

Our project teams are organized around well-defined roles including Project Managers who coordinate delivery and communications, Product Managers who define outcomes and prioritize backlogs, Developers who implement features and collaborate on design, QA/Testing professionals who validate quality, and Stakeholders who provide inputs and approvals. Each project follows a structured lifecycle from initiation through planning, execution, release, and retrospective phases, ensuring consistent delivery while maintaining flexibility for different project needs.

Communication is central to our success, with established cadences including weekly PM and Product Manager syncs, regular standups for delivery teams, monthly stakeholder updates, and structured escalation paths for issues. Our quality assurance practices integrate testing throughout the development process, from unit and integration tests to end-to-end smoke tests and security scanning, while our risk management processes help teams proactively identify and mitigate potential challenges.

The documentation follows our commitment to continuous improvement, with regular retrospectives and actionable improvements that help teams evolve their practices. These processes have been refined through real-world application and are designed to scale from small feature development to large cross-functional initiatives, always keeping the focus on delivering measurable value to customers and stakeholders.
